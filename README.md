phrames: A django-Inspired PHP ORM/Framework
===

## About

phrames was created by [Andrew Freiday](http://www.andrewfreiday.com) originally in hopes of replicating Python's django framework object-relational mapping (ORM).

IMPORTANT NOTE: This project is very much in development. It is certainly _not_ suitable for production use. It needs a lot of (unit) testing. Users should very much expect the interface to change over time, rendering previous versions deprecated/broken. For now, the github project page will simply serve as a random dumping ground for new features/updates/development work until it is production-worthy and a proper git workflow is established.

## Project Goals

There are a few primary goals/objectives that phrames was initially developed to achieve:

- Have a modular, lightweight codebase
- Be conducive to rapid development in a variety of iteration styles (database-first/code-later or code-first/database-later)
- Follow and improve upon the django-style syntax/model where possible within the current language feature constraints of PHP (when compared with Python)
- Attempt to find a balance between the most fluid, feature-rich interface and overall performance

## Basic Example

The following is just a brief display of some of the features of phrames. For more detailed feature descriptions, please see the documentation.

```php
<?php

  require_once("phrames/phrames.php");
  
  class User extends Model {
  
    protected static function fields() {
      return array(
        "id" => array(
          "type" => new IDField(),
        ),
        "username" => array(
          "__get" => function($v) {
            return strtolower($v);
          },
        ),
        "clubs" => array(
          "type" => new ManyToManyField("Club", "Membership"),
        ),
      );
    }
  
  }
  
  class Club extends Model {
  
    protected static function fields() {
      return array(
        "id" => array(
          "type" => IDField(),
        ),
        "members" => array(
          "type" => new ManyToManyField("User", "Membership"),
        ),
      );
    }
  
  }
  
  class Membership extends Model {
  
    protected static function fields() {
      return array(
        "id" => array(
          "type" => new IDField(),
        ),
        "user" => array(
          "type" => new ForeignKey("User"),
        ),
        "club" => array(
          "type" => new ForeignKey("Club"),
        ),
        "is_admin" => array(
          "type" => new BooleanField(),
          "required" => true,
        ),
      );
    }
  
  }
  
  $users = User::objects()->all(); // get all users
  
  $users->order_by("-username"); // sort descendingly by username
  
  foreach($users as $user) {
    print "{$user->real_name} ({$user->username}) is a member of:\n";
    foreach($user->clubs as $club) // get clubs user is a member of
      print "{$club->name}\n";
  }
  
  User::objects()->filter(Field::age__lt(18))->delete(); // delete users under 18
```

## TODO List

Next things to implement, in no particular order:

- Flexible cache integration
- Expanded list of ModelField types
- Database sharding support
- Query aggregation functions (avg, count, max, min, etc)
- Improve interface to reduce verbosity
- A lot later: templating layer, view layer, etc
