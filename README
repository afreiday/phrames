phrames is a personal project developed initially as a django-like ORM developed in PHP as a way to enhance my abilities with the more advanced features of the PHP language. As phrames becomes more and more important to me and my career as a developer, I hope to turn it into something that resembles a lightweight PHP framework that I, and others, can rely on for mission-critical, day-to-day operations and development.
